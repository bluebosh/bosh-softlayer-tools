# New softlayer CPI Summary

## manifest change  

This topic describes properties of deployment by comparing with the old SoftLayer CPI.

### AZs

AZs support the Director to eliminate and/or simplify manual configuration for balancing VMs across AZs and IP address management. Once AZs are defined, deployment jobs can be placed into one or more AZs.

AZs schema:  
  * azs [Array, required]: List of AZs.
  * name [String, required]: Name of an AZ within the Director.
  * cloud_properties [Hash, optional]: Describes any IaaS-specific properties needed to associated with AZ; for most IaaSes, some data here is actually required. See CPI Specific cloud_properties below. Example: availability_zone. Default is {} (empty Hash).

_Note that IaaS specific cloud properties related to AZs should now be only placed under azs. Make sure to remove them from resource_pools/vm_typesâ€™ cloud properties._

sample manifest for legacy softlayer cpi:  
```yaml
azs:
- name: z1
  cloud_properties:
    Datacenter: { Name: lon02 }
```

sample manifest for new softlayer cpi:  
```yaml
azs:
- name: z1
  cloud_properties:
    datacenter: lon02 
```

### Networks

There are three different network types: `manual`, `dynamic`, and `vip`. And softlayer-cpi does not support `vip` type at present.

Manual networks schema:  
  * name [String, required]: Name used to reference this network configuration
  * type [String, required]: Value should be manual
  * subnets [Array, required]: Lists subnets in this network
    * range [String, required]: Subnet IP range that includes all IPs from this subnet
    * gateway [String, required]: Subnet gateway IP
    * dns [Array, optional]: DNS IP addresses for this subnet
    * reserved [Array, optional]: Array of reserved IPs and/or IP ranges. BOSH does not assign IPs from this range to any VM
    * static [Array, optional]: Array of static IPs and/or IP ranges. BOSH assigns IPs from this range to jobs requesting static IPs. Only IPs specified here can be used for static IP reservations.
    * az [String, optional]: AZ associated with this subnet (should only be used when using first class AZs). Example: z1. Available in v241+.
    * azs [Array, optional]: List of AZs associated with this subnet (should only be used when using first class AZs). Example: [z1, z2]. Available in v241+.
    * cloud_properties [Hash, optional]: Describes any IaaS-specific properties for the subnet. Default is {} (empty Hash).

sample manifest of static network for legacy softlayer cpi:  
```yaml

```

  * type [String, required]: Value should be dynamic
  * dns [Array, optional]: DNS IP addresses for this network
  * cloud_properties [Hash, optional]: Describes any IaaS-specific properties for the network. Default is {} (empty Hash).

```yaml
networks
- name: dynamic
  type: dynamic
  dns: [8.8.8.8, 10.0.80.11, 10.0.80.12]
  cloud_properties:
    PrimaryNetworkComponent:

        Id: 524956
    PrimaryBackendNetworkComponent:
      NetworkVlan:
        Id: 524954
```

sample manifest of dynamic network for new softlayer cpi:  
```yaml

  cloud_properties:
    vlanIds: [((sl_vlan_public_id)), ((sl_vlan_private_id))]
   dns: [8.8.8.8, 10.0.80.11, 10.0.80.12]
```

### VM Types/Resource Pools

VM type is a named Virtual Machine size configuration in the cloud config.
Resource pool is collections of VMs created from the same stemcell, with the same configuration, in a deployment.

Vm_types schema:  
  * vm_types [Array, required]: Specifies the VM types available to deployments. At least one should be specified.
    * name [String, required]: A unique name used to identify and reference the VM type
    * cloud_properties [Hash, optional]: Describes any IaaS-specific properties needed to create VMs; for most IaaSes, some data here is actually required. See CPI Specific cloud_properties below. Example: instance_type: m3.medium. Default is {} (empty Hash).

sample manifest of legacy softlayer cpi: 
```yaml
vm_types:
- name: default
  cloud_properties:
    bosh_ip: ((internal_ip))
    startCpus:  4
    maxMemory:  8192
    ephemeralDiskSize: 100
    hourlyBillingFlag: true
    vmNamePrefix: manifest-sample
    domain: sofltayer.com
```

sample manifest for new softlayer cpi:  
```yaml
vm_types:
- name: default
  cloud_properties:
    startCpus:  4
    maxMemory:  8192
    ephemeralDiskSize: 100
    hourlyBillingFlag: true
    vmNamePrefix: manifest-sample
    domain: sofltayer.com
```

### Disk types/Disk Pools

Disk Type (previously known as Disk Pool) is a named disk configuration specified in the cloud config.

* disk_types [Array, required]: Specifies the disk types available to deployments. At least one should be specified.
    * name [String, required]: A unique name used to identify and reference the disk type
    * disk_size [Integer, required]: Specifies the disk size. disk_size must be a positive integer. BOSH creates a persistent disk of that size in megabytes and attaches it to each job instance VM.
    * cloud_properties [Hash, optional]: Describes any IaaS-specific properties needed to create disks. Examples: type, iops. Default is {} (empty Hash).

sample manifest of legacy softlayer cpi: 
```yaml
disk_types:
- name: disks
  disk_size: 100_000
  cloud_properties:
    Iops: 3000
    UseHourlyPricing: true
```

sample manifest for new softlayer cpi:  
```yaml
disk_types:
- name: disks
  disk_size: 100_000
  cloud_properties:
    iops: 3000
    useHourlyPricing: true
    snapshotSpace: 20

```

How about add sample manifest of simpler case.

## Comparison with legacy CPI

### softlayer-go

1. new Softlayer CPI is moved to SL official `softlayer-go` lib.  
Each data types and service methods of the lib is pre-generated, using the SoftLayer API metadata endpoint as input, thus ensuring 100% coverage of the API right out of the gate. The library use a session to manage all Softlayer Services, every services has own methods. Services-relative data can be queried by calling the Mask(), Filter(), Limit() and Offset() service methods prior to invoking an API method. All non-slice method parameters are passed as pointers. Like method parameters, all non-slice members are declared as pointers in datatypes. A custom error type is returned when API services error occurs, with individual fields that can be parsed separately.

And `softlayer-go` Add wait/retry logic to retry the api requests if there is a timeout error. 

So we combine the 3-layer wait/retry mechanism:  
1. softlayer-go covers connection timeout error. The transport handler of softlayer-go support the retry of connectino error. It contains http timeout error(408 Request Timeout, 504 Gateway Timeout, 599 Network connect timeout) and transport timeout error[[#2](https://github.com/softlayer/softlayer-go/blob/retries/session/session.go#L284-L301).
2. CPI covers Softlayer resource 'Not_Found' error and registry timeout error. When CPI calls specific softlayer API such getObject and Softlayer return 'Not_Found' error, CPI will wait 5 seconds and retry in one minute.
3. Bosh director cover CPI actions' retries when CPI return error with positive ok_to_retry. For example, CPI would return a error with positive ok_to_retry when calling Softlayer Virtual Guest Serivce create Object failed as long as the parameter check is correct before call API methods.
